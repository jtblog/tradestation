/**
 * Abstract class ALiaison.<br>
 * <br>
 * It's main trade server communicator class.
 * The class is abstract, all actual communication code should be in its subclasses.
 * Liaison should provide following functionality:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Retain trade server connection;</li>
 * <li>Send async requests to trade server;</li>
 * <li>Provide status of the liaison;</li>
 * <li>Provide general business logic information common to the system (such as account currency);</li>
 * <li>Update client business data;</li>
 * </ul>
 * Liaison features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It's singleton class</li>
 * <li>ï¿½Interface of the liaison is general enough so it should be easy
 * customized for use with different trade servers and trading protocols
 * (RapidFX server or zDAS server);</li>
 * <li>All requests (and login/logout commands too) are async so the method
 * implementation should begin process of the request and returns immediately,
 * when request will be completed special listener method will be called,
 * note that it can be called in context of other thread that caller one;</li>
 * <li>Liaison can process the only command at one time,
 * if liaison is busy (process some command) and client
 * sends other request exception can be throw;</li>
 * <li>
 * To decrease dependency from trade server and data protocol,
 * liaison will update trade data on client itself,
 * these trade data can be accessed through ITradeDesk interface;
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Liaison should retain connection with server,
 * when connection is lost (or other error occurred) liaison should
 * try to restore connection insensibly to user.
 * When some critical error occurred
 * (for example liaison failed to restore connection) it should send
 * notification to caller application;
 * </li>
 * </ul>
